# Modeling & Analysis Code

This repository contains all code, cleaned data, and results for our comparative modeling study using CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, LightGBM, TabTransformer, and TabNet, along with data‚Äëcleaning and sample‚Äëextraction scripts.

  Contains all model notebooks in Google Colab format.
- **Datasets**  
  Fully cleaned **Train** and **Test** datasets (after all transformations).
- **Excel‚ÄØSheet‚ÄØBased‚ÄØAnalysis**  
  Visual summaries: plots, averages, and top‚Äë5 result tables.
- **Results**  
  Model outputs: confusion matrices, performance metrics, and 15 sample test predictions.

##  To Run the Codes (in Google Colab)

1. **Mount Google Drive**
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
2. **Load the Test and Train dataset paths**
   ```python
   train_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Big Data Analysis and Project - a1906525/Datasets/crime_train_final.csv"
   test_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Big Data Analysis and Project - a1906525/Datasets/crime_test_cleaned.csv"
3. **Modelling**
   As the modelling parts of LightGBM, CatBoost, HGB Classifier were run on L4 GPU, change the runtime type if needed.
